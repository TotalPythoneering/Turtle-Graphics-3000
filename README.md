# Turtle-Graphics-3000
Python's unique "batteries included" philosophy includes support for creating some extremely interesting graphics.
Starting our, here is the complete source code and examples for my "Python 3000 - Turtle Graphics" educational 'op.

# The Channel
Part of a new [Total Pythoneering Channel (https://www.youtube.com/@TotalPythoneering) on the 'Tube now that the educational videos have been banned on Udemy (after years they decided they did not like my icons?!) I'll be sharing my entire set of lessons (Python 3000 "Cartesian Planes & Plotting", Python 4000 "Graphical Planes and Plotting for Pythoneers", and Python 5000 "Cartesian Frameworks") on "Total Pythoneering."

# The Playlsit
This repo shares that '3000 set of support code (examples as well as lab exercises.) Over 10 hours of training to share (around 4 hours per level,) the playlist is available [here](https://youtu.be/trtr0Fv97jM?si=qBP_SVgeY1rJX2UU).

Here is [the how-to video](https://youtu.be/fARxiPCnfzA?si=4id9dZ0kjPtOdIgP).

# The Community
If you can possibly afford to support the effort then you can gift me a 'cuppa on [ko-fi.com](https://ko-fi.com/randallnagy).


Happy Pythoneering,
